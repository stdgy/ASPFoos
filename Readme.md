# ASP.Net Core Foosball Project
This is just a simple ASP.Net Core project I've created to see what it's
like to build a simple CRUD app using different pieces of Microsoft's new
stack.

At the moment this is just a back-side heavy app. So all rendering is being
done on the backend using templates. A future project would be to create a
SPA using Angular or React and see how easy it is to tie that into an ASP.Net
MVC/Web API backend.

### Technology Used
- ASP.Net Core
- Entity Framework
